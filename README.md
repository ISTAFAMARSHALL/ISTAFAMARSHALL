For over 15 years, I immersed myself in the demanding but rewarding realm of customer service across various industries. This experience has given me a profound understanding of people, their pain points, their desires, and the tiny inconveniences they face that technology can solve. 

I've come to realize that good service is not just about immediate solutions it's about creating systems that anticipate needs and address them proactively. The same principle applies to technology. We don’t just need apps and websites that are functional; we need those that 'understand' the user. That’s why, after 15 years in customer service, I decided to turn toward software engineering as a second act in my professional journey. I wanted to create technological solutions as intuitive and responsive as a seasoned customer service rep.

My recent graduation from Flatiron School was an exhilarating period of growth. I gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end technologies. The unique edge I bring stems from my prior life in customer service. When I code, I am not just thinking about syntax and function; I am thinking about that end-user who will interact with my creation.

The beauty of coupling technical skills with customer service acumen—you start to see technology not just as code, but as an experience, an interface between people and machines that should be as smooth as possible. I'm not just a developer; I am an experience creator. I don’t just solve problems; I anticipate them. As I continue to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field, my mission is simply to create innovative, user-centric applications that solve real-world problems and make people's lives a little bit easier.
