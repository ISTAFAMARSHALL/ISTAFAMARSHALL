#From 15+ Years in Customer Service to Full-Stack Developer:
 
##Hello I am Istafa Anthony Marshall 

###In a world where technology evolves by the minute, it’s easy for developers to lose sight of the end user. But for me, Istafa Anthony Marshall, the user has always been at the forefront of what I do, even before I took the coding plunge. How so? For over 15 years, I immersed myself in the demanding but rewarding realm of customer service across various industries. This experience has given me a profound understanding of people, their pain points, their desires, and the tiny inconveniences they face that technology can solve. It's this very human-centric perspective that I bring into my life as a full-stack developer today.

As someone who has managed emergency services, coordinated with technicians, and facilitated countless customer interactions, I've come to realize that good service is not just about immediate solutions—it's about creating systems that anticipate needs and address them proactively. The same principle applies to technology. We don’t just need apps and websites that are functional; we need those that 'understand' the user. That’s why, after 15 years in customer service, I decided to turn toward software engineering as a second act in my professional journey. I wanted to create technological solutions as intuitive and responsive as a seasoned customer service rep.

My recent graduation from Flatiron School was an exhilarating period of growth. I gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end technologies—Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, JavaScript, React, you name it. But the unique edge I bring stems from my prior life in customer service. When I code, I am not just thinking about syntax and function; I am thinking about that end-user who will interact with my creation. Will this API make sense to them? Is this application solving a real-world problem or merely showcasing technical fireworks? Can this app adapt to diverse user needs, or is it a rigid structure that users must awkwardly navigate around?

This perspective came to life during one of my personal projects, where I developed an API for an educational management tool. While a straightforward task for most developers, I went a step further to integrate features that resonate with both educators and students, features that anticipate their needs and create an engaging experience. That’s the beauty of coupling technical skills with customer service acumen—you start to see technology not just as code, but as an experience, an interface between people and machines that should be as smooth as possible.

Now, as I step into the professional world of software development, I am keen on roles that allow me to leverage both my customer service experience and my technical skills. I'm not just a developer; I am an experience creator. I don’t just solve problems; I anticipate them. As I continue to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field, my mission is simple but deeply ingrained in my career fabric—to create innovative, user-centric applications that solve real-world problems and make people's lives a little bit easier.

So, whether you’re a company looking for a developer who understands both people and machines, or a project manager in need of someone who gets the bigger picture, I’m your guy. Let’s connect and build something meaningful and user-focused together.
